# 🧠 AI Swarm Council

A 4-stage collaborative intelligence system for research exploration using multiple AI models.

## 🔄 4-Stage Process

### Stage 1: Diverse Idea Generation
- 5 agents with different perspectives generate unique insights
- Each brings their cognitive/clinical/assessment/technology/cross-cultural lens

### Stage 2: Anonymous Peer Review (Karpathy-style)
- Each agent reviews ALL ideas without knowing who created what
- Identifies strengths, weaknesses, missing elements
- Ranks proposals from strongest to weakest

### Stage 3: Superior Synthesis
- Takes original ideas + ALL peer critiques
- Integrates best elements from multiple proposals
- Addresses weaknesses identified in reviews
- Combines complementary insights
- Produces something better than any individual proposal

### Stage 4: Research Proposal (Optional)
- Generates concrete research proposal based on synthesis
