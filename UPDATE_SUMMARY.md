| 📊 Assessment Specialist | Gemini 2.0 Flash | **GPT-OSS-120B** | OpenAI model for structured thinking |
| 💻 Technology Innovator | Claude Sonnet 4 | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Latest from Anthropic |
| 🌍 Cross-Cultural | Llama 3.3 70B | **GLM 4.7** | Chinese model for authentic global perspective |

## 📊 Model Rationale

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Used for Cognitive Scientist & Technology Innovator)
- Best-in-class analytical reasoning
- Excellent at theory synthesis and innovation
- Latest capabilities from Anthropic

**Gemini 3 Flash Preview** (Clinical Educator)
- Fast, practical thinking
- Good for implementation considerations
- Latest preview from Google

**GPT-OSS-120B** (Assessment Specialist)
- Structured, methodological thinking
- Strong at measurement frameworks
- Precision for psychometric work

**GLM 4.7** (Cross-Cultural Researcher)
- **Authentic diversity**: Chinese-developed model
- Brings non-Western perspective
- Strong cross-cultural reasoning

## 📁 Updated Files

All documentation updated to reflect new models:

✅ `streamlit_app.py` - Model assignments
✅ `STREAMLIT_README.md` - Features and pricing
✅ `QUICKSTART.md` - Setup guide
✅ `USER_EXPERIENCE.md` - UI documentation
✅ `MODEL_RATIONALE.md` - **NEW** - Detailed model explanations
✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - **NEW** - Version history

## 🚀 Deploy This Update

### If running locally:
```bash
# Just restart your app with the new file
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### If on Streamlit Cloud:
1. Push updated `streamlit_app.py` to GitHub
2. Streamlit Cloud auto-deploys
3. Done! ✨

## 💰 Cost Update

- **Previous**: ~$0.10-0.30 per exploration
- **New**: ~$0.10-0.40 per exploration
- Slight increase due to latest model versions
- Still very affordable!

## 🎯 What You Get

**Better Quality:**
- Latest reasoning capabilities
- Authentic cultural diversity (GLM from China vs Western Llama)
- Specialized models for each role

**Same Experience:**
- UI identical
- Workflow unchanged
- No breaking changes

## 🔧 Easy Customization

Want different models? Just edit this section in `streamlit_app.py`:

```python
SWARM_AGENTS = [
    {
        'id': 'cognitive',
        'name': 'Cognitive Scientist',
        'model': 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5-20250514',  # Change here
        ...
    }
]
```

All OpenRouter models available: https://openrouter.ai/models

## 📚 New Documentation

**MODEL_RATIONALE.md** - Read this to understand:
- Why each model was chosen for its role
- Strengths of each model
- How to customize for your needs
- Alternative model suggestions

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Push to your Streamlit Cloud or run locally
2. **Test**: Try an exploration with the new models
3. **Compare**: Notice improved reasoning quality
4. **Customize**: Adjust models if you prefer different ones

## 🤝 Support

Everything working? The app should now:
- Show new model names in sidebar
- Use latest capabilities
- Provide more diverse perspectives (especially with GLM 4.7!)

Questions? Check:
- MODEL_RATIONALE.md for model details
- CHANGELOG.md for version history
- OpenRouter docs for model specs

Enjoy your upgraded multi-model research swarm! 🎉
